# Cardio-Vascular-Desease-Anticipation(Must open the code with github.dev) 
This study analyzes a cardiovascular disease dataset to predict cardiac dysfunction using various machine learning techniques. The dataset, consisting of 70,000 rows and 13 columns, includes patient information such as age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and a binary target indicating the presence of cardiac dysfunction.

The data preparation steps involve removing unnecessary columns, such as the unique ID, and converting age from days to years for better interpretability. Various data visualization techniques using matplotlib and seaborn are employed to explore the dataset. Additionally, confusion matrix and classification report metrics are utilized to evaluate model performance, and the confusion matrix is visualized using mlxtend's plotting module.

The study aims to provide insights into the significant factors contributing to cardiovascular diseases and to develop a predictive model with high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The findings and visualizations offer a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and the model's effectiveness in predicting cardiac dysfunction.
